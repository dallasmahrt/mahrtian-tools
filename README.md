This is my personal toollbox where I place utilities that I find useful. This isn't necessarily pretty code (although aim for it be be good). 

Tools
=====

* grokk - Perform a grep on all files with a specific extension (recursively)
* kludge - Record a horrible hack that is performed on the command line so we don't forget
* statsit - Take a file with a record per line, split on a delimiter and generate statistics for a set of fields.
